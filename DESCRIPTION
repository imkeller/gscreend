Description: Package for the analysis of pooled genetic screens (e.g. CRISPR-KO). The analysis of such screens is based on the comparison of gRNA abundances before and after a cell proliferation phase. The gscreend packages takes gRNA counts as input and allows detection of genes whose knockout decreases or increases cell proliferation.
